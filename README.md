# Summary
The Emacs config that I use for when I use Emacs.

# PREQUISITE
```
You must have Emacs (obviously)
After you paste my init.el contents onto your .emacs or init.el file or downloading it and having it as your init.el file. Do the following

--If you want C++ support--
1.Install clangd. You would want to head to their website for guidance on doing so https://clangd.llvm.org/installation

-- refresh-contents inside your init.el file (M-x <RET> package-refresh-contents <RET>)
This package use all-the-icons so once you refresh don't forget to do M-x RET all-the-icons-install-fonts RET
  
```
# This is MOSTLY C++ BASED, IF NOT ENTIRELY!
My preferred programming language is C++. So, obviously, this .emacs is based for C++ use.

# UPDATE: Added GoLang go-mode support
I've been interested in the GO Programming Language. I added support for that in configuration. <br>
Just follow the basic steps such as GO installation and gopls installation
